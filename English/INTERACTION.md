# Interaction

This is a document that will be further elaborated in terms of content.
You can expect from us that we will add pointers on how to deal with:

- **Issues.** The basic principle is that anyone can submit suggestions for change.
  It will be determined how quickly we will be respond, what priority will be 
  assigned to it en which tags we will use (feature request, bug etc.)
- **Pull Requests.** Things like reaction time and how, for example, the assessment 
  by co-contributors will be weighted. AAll contributions that have been accepted
  must have been viewed by another contributor for a new release.
- **Code review.** Mandatory or not and by whom, will be a points of attention here.
- **Patches.** For example, whether patches are only accepted through Github or also
  through other channels (such as e-mail).

## Code of Conduct
